# Monte Carlo Simulations - Infinite Slope Stability

This is a web application developed in R programming language and deployed using shiny package via [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) servers. It deals with calculation of probability failure of a an infinite slope (geotechnical problem) based on a range of input parameters.  

The web application ca be accessed via the following link:

The **user manual** is also included in this repository, as well as sample csv's which were used to run the study case (also described in the user manual), so the results in the user manual can be reproduced.

By default the program loads up a sample csv for soil  weight and slope angle, to showcase how the application works with a csv as an input option without having the user input a csv file. When a different csv file is selected and uploaded, the default information form sample.csv is overwritten.
